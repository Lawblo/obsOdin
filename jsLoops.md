# jsLoops

A loop usually has one or more of the following features:

-   A **counter**, which is initialized with a certain value — this is the starting point of the loop.
-   A **condition**, which is a true/false test to determine whether the loop continues to run, or stops — usually when the counter reaches a certain value. 
-   An **iterator**, which generally increments the counter by a small amount on each successive loop until the condition is no longer `true`. 


#### The For Loop
```JavaScript
for (initializer; condition; final-expression) {
  // code to run
}
```

#### Exiting loops with break
