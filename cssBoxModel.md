Basically, every single thing on a webpage is a rectangular box. These boxes can have other boxes in them and can sit alongside one another

Manipulate these boxes can be done by using margin, padding and border

**Padding** increases the space between the edge of a box and the content inside of it

**Margin** increases the space between a box and any others that sit next to it

**Border** adds space between the margin and the padding
