# DOM Manipulation
DOM stands for the Document Object Model, and is a tree-like representation of the contetns of a webpage - a tree of "nodes" with different relationships depending on how they're arranged in the HTML document. 

## Targeting Nodes with Selectors
When working with the DOM, you use “selectors” to target the nodes you want to work with. You can use a combination of CSS-style selectors and relationship properties to target the nodes you want.
