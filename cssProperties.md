#### Image Height and Width
Height and widht values same as actual image file properties by defeault

Can set either height or width as a specific size and the other as auto to keep **proportions**

Its usually a good idea to include width and height, in order to reserve som space and not  make the rest of the page shift drastically when it loads in
